# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing PySide6-based Inventory Management System to a Streamlit web application. The migration aims to eliminate Windows Defender false positives, simplify deployment across multiple PCs on the local network, and provide a modern web-based interface while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to access the inventory management system through a web browser, so that I don't need to install software on each PC and avoid Windows Defender issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the web application URL THEN the system SHALL display the main dashboard with three primary functions
2. WHEN the user accesses the application from any PC on the local network THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality without local installation
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger Windows Defender warnings or require executable files on client PCs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to update inventory from supplier emails, so that I can maintain accurate stock levels in the POS system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates inventory update THEN the system SHALL connect to Gmail and retrieve supplier inventory files
2. WHEN supplier files are downloaded THEN the system SHALL process files from all configured suppliers (AL, VF, BY, NBF, OUTRE, HZ, SNG, MANE)
3. WHEN inventory data is processed THEN the system SHALL update the Microsoft SQL POS database with new inventory levels
4. WHEN the update process runs THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress and status updates
5. IF email access fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual file upload as a fallback option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to analyze Amazon orders for inventory planning, so that I can generate accurate item ordering forms based on demand vs available stock.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses Amazon order analysis THEN the system SHALL retrieve current orders via Amazon SP-API
2. WHEN orders are displayed THEN the system SHALL show order details in a sortable, filterable table with inventory comparison
3. WHEN the user analyzes orders THEN the system SHALL compare Amazon order quantities against POS stock levels and company inventory
4. WHEN inventory analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate item ordering forms showing items that need restocking
5. WHEN the user requests order forms THEN the system SHALL generate downloadable Excel files for supplier ordering

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to generate sales reports through the web interface, so that I can analyze store performance and inventory needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses sales reporting THEN the system SHALL provide date range selection controls
2. WHEN date ranges are selected THEN the system SHALL query the POS database for sales data
3. WHEN sales data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports with inventory analysis
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide download options for Excel format
5. WHEN the report process runs THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and completion status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the web application to run on a single server PC, so that I can centralize maintenance and ensure consistent access across the network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL run on a designated server PC accessible via local network IP
2. WHEN the server application starts THEN the system SHALL be accessible from all PCs on the network via web browser
3. WHEN multiple users access simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent sessions without conflicts
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply updates without requiring client-side changes
5. IF the server PC restarts THEN the system SHALL automatically resume service without manual intervention

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business user, I want all existing data connections to work seamlessly, so that the migration doesn't disrupt current operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web application connects to the database THEN the system SHALL use existing Microsoft SQL connection configurations
2. WHEN the application accesses Gmail THEN the system SHALL use existing authentication credentials and email filters
3. WHEN the system calls Amazon SP-API THEN the system SHALL use existing API credentials and marketplace configurations
4. WHEN supplier configurations are loaded THEN the system SHALL use existing JSON configuration files without modification
5. WHEN file processing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with all current supplier file formats

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the web interface to be intuitive and responsive, so that I can work efficiently without extensive retraining.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads any page THEN the system SHALL display content within 3 seconds
2. WHEN the user interacts with controls THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN long operations run THEN the system SHALL display progress bars and status messages
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
5. WHEN the user completes tasks THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and next-step guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation executes THEN the system SHALL log activities with timestamps and user context
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN external services fail THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and user notifications
4. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL verify all external connections and report status
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain system stability and provide recovery options
